            <p>This study analyzed how the depth of conversation affects the individual evaluation of interactions with AI by assigning 89 participants to either a <a href="deepTalk.html" target="_blank"><b>deep talk</b></a> or a <a href="shallowTalk.html" target="_blank"><b>shallow talk</b></a> with a chatbot.</p>
            <p>It also investigated whether this individual engagement and evaluation of interactions with these different conversational agents differs between individuals with a high vs. low level of <a href="https://centerofinquiry.org/uncategorized/need-for-cognition-scale-wabash-national-study/" target="_blank"><b>need for cognition (NFC)</b></a>.</p>
            <p>Three dimensions were compared:
            <br>(1) number of questions participants answered
            <br>(2) length of responses
            <br>(3) evaluation.</p>

            <p align="center"><b>Figure 1. The comparison of the engagement and evaluation between the two conditions.</b></p>

            <p align="center"><img src="assets/img/chatbot/Figure 7.jpeg"></p>
            <p align="center"><b>Figure 3. Interaction Between depth and NFC level on the evaluation.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>Results suggest that deep conversation is generally more likely to arouse longer responses and high opinion for the chatbot (Figure 1&2), and people who score low in NFC enjoy the deep talk better than people who are high in NFC. (Figure 2&3)</p>
            <!--p>A mild moderating effect of NFC between the conversational depth and the evaluation was found, but it is opposite to our assumption that deep talk would be more appealing to high-NFC individuals.</p>
            <p>In both conditions, high-NFC participants significantly typed more than low-NFC participants, but low-NFC participants also engaged more in a deep talk than in a shallow talk.</p-->
            <p>In contrast to the speculation, the findings imply that the deep talk, rather than the shallow talk, is more appealing to low-NFC individuals: Low-NFC participants were more satisfied with the deep talk than the shallow talk, while for high-NFC individuals, the evaluation of the deep talk is on average even lower than the shallow talk.</p>
            <p>A possible reason supported by results for this deviation from the assumptions based on NFC theories is that low-NFC individuals feel understood more easily during the conversation with chatbots, leading to more positive attitudes toward the chat experience, whereas high-NFC individuals are inclined to prefer communication with humans and are unlikely to feel understood or perceive a talk with chatbots as “deep”.</p>

            <p align="center"><b>Figure 4. The positive relationship between feeling understood and evaluation.</b></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="assets/img/chatbot/Figure 11.jpeg"></p>
            <p align="center"><b>Figure 5. Relationships between NFC groups and feeling understood.</b></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="assets/img/chatbot/Figure 12.jpeg"></p>
            <p align="center"><b>Figure 6. The positive relationship between perceived as deep and evaluation.</b></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="assets/img/chatbot/Figure 13.jpeg"></p>
            <p align="center"><b>Figure 7. Relationships between NFC groups and perceived as deep.</b></p>
            <p>As the observations indicate, the deepness was perceived especially when people felt understood by the chatbot, and their evaluation is highly related to these factors as well. (Figure 4&6)</p>
            <p>This phenomenon is aligned with the observations of NFC research that simple pre-defined artificial conversational agents could fulfill communicative needs of low-NFC individuals more easily, who handle information roughly because they are not so keen on thinking hard. (Figure 5&7)</p>
            <p>But chatbots could hardly satisfy high-NFC people, who are adept at understanding abstract verbal information and process thoroughly and critically, they require the bots to reply to their messages like intelligent humans.</p>
            <p>Just as some participants expressed their disappointment in the feedback, they figured out the responses from the chatbot were pre-defined, so it could not converse with true understanding, or the empathy it showed was actually fake.</p>
            <p>Therefore, considering individual personalities, people who are low in NFC are expected to be more willing to accept and enjoy talking with conversational agents than people high in NFC.</p>
